///
/// ## Why `NSObject`
/// IOBluetooth's notification APIs are old-style Cocoa target/selector, not
/// closures — `IOBluetoothDevice.register(forConnectNotifications:selector:)`
/// takes an `Any!` target and a `Selector!`, and delivers the callback as a
/// plain Objective-C message send to an `@objc` method on that target. That
/// target must be an `NSObject` subclass (a bare Swift class has no
/// Objective-C runtime identity to message), hence `BluetoothMonitor: NSObject,
/// ObservableObject` rather than the plain `final class: ObservableObject`
/// used elsewhere in this codebase.
///
/// Unlike `PowerMonitor`'s raw `@convention(c)` callback (which categorically
/// cannot run on the main actor without an explicit assertion — see that
/// type's doc comment), these `@objc` methods are ordinary instance methods
/// on a `@MainActor` class receiving an Objective-C message send. Swift's
/// concurrency checker doesn't (can't) verify the caller's thread for a
/// dynamically-dispatched selector invoked from a C API, so the isolation
/// check is only load-bearing at compile time for statically-typed Swift
/// call sites — this is the same trust boundary as `Timer`'s closure-based
/// target-action or `NotificationCenter`'s block observers elsewhere in the
/// app: correctness rests on the framework's documented behavior (IOBluetooth
/// delivers on the run loop current at registration — main, here, since
/// `start()` is only ever called from app launch on the main actor) rather
/// than a compiler-checked guarantee.
